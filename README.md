# Smart Event & Hackathon Management System

## Project Overview

The Smart Event & Hackathon Management System is a comprehensive Salesforce CRM solution designed to automate and streamline the complete lifecycle of hackathon and event management. This system addresses critical challenges in event organization by providing end-to-end automation for participant registration, team formation, mentor/judge assignment, scheduling, scoring, and result tracking.

The solution ensures transparency, efficiency, and real-time visibility across all stakeholders including participants, mentors, judges, sponsors, and organizers through a centralized CRM platform.
